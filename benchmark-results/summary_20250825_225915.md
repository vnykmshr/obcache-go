# obcache-go Benchmark Results

Generated on: Mon Aug 25 23:00:38 +0545 2025

## Overview

This report contains comprehensive benchmark results for obcache-go, measuring:
- Basic cache operations performance
- Function wrapping overhead and benefits
- Concurrent access patterns
- Singleflight effectiveness
- Key generation performance
- Real-world usage simulations

## How to Read Results

Benchmark results format:
```
BenchmarkName-8    iterations    ns/op    B/op    allocs/op
```

- **iterations**: Number of times the benchmark ran
- **ns/op**: Nanoseconds per operation (lower is better)
- **B/op**: Bytes allocated per operation (lower is better)
- **allocs/op**: Number of allocations per operation (lower is better)

## Key Findings

### Cache Effectiveness
- Compare BenchmarkDirect* vs BenchmarkWrapped* results
- Look for significant performance improvements in cached scenarios
- Note the trade-off between first call overhead and subsequent call speed

### Concurrency Performance
- Concurrent benchmarks show the library's thread-safety overhead
- Singleflight benchmarks demonstrate deduplication effectiveness

### Memory Usage
- Lower allocations/op indicates better memory efficiency
- Key generation strategy impacts memory usage
